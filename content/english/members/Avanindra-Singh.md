I joined Adhiyagya because I wanted to gain some experience of managing kids . One of the goals in my life is to start a school in my home town in Himachal Pradesh so after my graduation i decided to join Adhiyagya.


### Special Moment
It has been around 6 months since I joined Adhiyagya. The special moment that I had during my short yet wonderful journey was when my grandmother appreciated my work of teaching mathematics  to our students in Hindi .
