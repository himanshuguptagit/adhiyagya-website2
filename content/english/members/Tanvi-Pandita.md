I joined Adhiyagya out of my curiosity and hope to do something worthwile with my life, to connect more with people and get myself to learn more.

### Special Moment
It has to be the Annual Function of Adhiyagya where the kids started cheering and clapping for me when I was presented with a certificate. No doubt, it's one of the most overwhelming moments I have experienced because in the cheering crowd there were so many faces I didn't know personally, but I was moved with each and every cheer. These kids are the purest form of motivation and encouragement one can experience. They drive me to do better for them and myself.
