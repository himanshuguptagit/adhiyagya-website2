It was a dream to be able to serve the society. Adhiyaga has helped me fulfill that dream.

### Special Moment
The love received from the children of Adhiyagya has made every moment special. The love that the children shower makes you feel that you belong to them. The most favourite times spend at Adhiyagya are the ones when we prepare for any events. Adhiyagya has become an extended family.
