I always wanted to help in the education field and I was introduced to Adhiyagya by a good friend. The first meeting with Kunjal di made an everlasting impact and I never left. Even after transitioning to different cities and countries, I still would do anything to help these kids out and work for Adhiyagya in any way possible.

### Special Moment
Every moment with Adhiyagya has been special. From celebrating birthdays and events to being called the favourite bhaiya by the kids, its been exceptional. Working with Kunjal di and the team of volunteers to secure a better future for these kids has been mesmerising.
