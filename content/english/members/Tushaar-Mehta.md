Our lives revolve revolve around ourselves and the people we are attached to. We toil and work hard to make our lives better. Adhiyagya gave me an opportunity to actually make a difference in the lives of the not so lucky ones. If a little effort of my can lighten someone's life, then why not do it. The satisfaction is divine.

### Special Moment
I was given a new batch of very young kids. I started to teach them phonics and after a month's efforts the kids started to understand sounds. Being a novice at teaching it made feel proud of myself that I could make them understand what I wanted to impart. 
Being a part of this noble cause is intself is special. I cherish each and every moment I spend here.
