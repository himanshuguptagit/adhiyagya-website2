## ABOUT OUR JOURNEY

Adhiyagya is an NGO working towards the empowerment of children through Education. The NGO focuses on providing free quality education to children from the economically weaker sections of the society who have been deprived of it either due to lack of resources or lack of awareness.

Adhiyagya started its operations in January 2015 and has worked with over 200 children, continuously striving to bring a constructive difference in their lives. The operations are at present carried out from three centers at Rajasthani Camp, Sarita Vihar, Sector 45, Faridabad and Lal Singh Basti, Bathinda.

The focus of the organization is to provide quality education wherein currently the projects undertaken involve English, Mathematics and Computer education along with special emphasis on moral values and discipline. The organization also works towards the wholesome development of the children and therefore many events and activities are organized wherein the children are provided a platform to showcase their talent that helps boost their self-confidence.

We strongly believe that Education has the power to make a difference in the society and it is our endeavor to help children come out of the shackles of illiteracy and ignorance by guiding them through the journey of gaining knowledge.

Adhiyagya is a Non-governmental organization having no political, religious and commercial intent. It is a registered trust and is eligible for tax exemption under Section 80G of Income Tax Act, 1961.

## Idealogy
Education for all -This constitutional right is still a faraway dream for majority of Indian children. We come from a society where children do not have the access to basic rights such as food, clothing, shelter and safety. Hence education becomes an unimportant, privileged right, giving rise to the belief that it is not meant for everyone.

However, education is not only a right but also an asset that truly empowers people. It can be a solution to most of the problems faced by us in India. Education has the power to make the difference and actually be a force to put an end to the vicious circle of poverty. However for that the focus needs to be on ‘Education for all’. We cannot move forward as a society till the time we are not able to provide education to all children. Education is not a luxury to be afforded by the rich; it is a right that every child in this country needs to get. To ensure this change it is essential to create opportunity. It is essential to create hopes and dreams. It is essential to create awareness. It is also essential to break all socioeconomic barriers that have formed an adverse outlook in the minds of people since ages. It is time we consider Education as a compulsion where the receiver does not face any discrimination whatsoever. It is time where the specific needs of various segments are understood and appropriate methods be used. No educated person ever let’s his children go uneducated. The reason behind this is that that person realizes its importance and the difference that education has made to his life. Therefore in our view, the task at hand is to educate one generation of each family and that will ensure cessation of illiteracy from that family.
