A zeal to connect and grow and help others in the same process. To hone qualities such as patience and discipline and curiosity and enable the children to do so as well.

### Special Moment
There really is no one special moment. Every day is special. The whole process of being the teacher and the taught creates a space for both the kids and me to flower and open up to each other. My children are motivated, disciplined and curious-all of which enables me to teach them with a greater connect and passion. It is not just the details of the subject to be taught but also the approach that matters. Life is full of subtleties and if the kids are able to notice that,the learning process will become more effort less. Watching kids coming to the class with a smile and a  "hello didi" makes me feel very blessed. The kids do their homework and sometimes we chat about movies and songs. The whole process become a reverse psychology of sorts. While talking to them I am reminded of my student days and that usually the teacher that you connect best with is also the subject in which the kids put more effort.
