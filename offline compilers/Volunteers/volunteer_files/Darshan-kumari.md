I wanted to do social service since very long.As soon as I came to know abt Adhyyagya, I attended 1 class & found the real place to make effords
It's a very honest & caring organisation. Its proud to be here &, worth spending time & energy on the students who really r in need of it.

### Special Moment
Adhyyagya celebrates all events of all religions. This way our children learn & respect the equality of all religions. All religions teach the same thing & they all should be respected.I really enjoyed special moments on the celebrations of all religions equally.
