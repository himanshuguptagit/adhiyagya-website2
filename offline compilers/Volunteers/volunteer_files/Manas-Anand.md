Adhiyagya to me has been a platform to not only let explore my social personality but also to return to the society in the best way I can, in the smallest of my capacities, that is, by the gift of imparting education.

### Special Moment
Despite having a very disturbed phase in my life, Adhiyagya has been a reason and a place I look forward to going each time with the same enthusiasm as the first day. The enthusiasm and intrigue this place has to offer and the joy you get when given so much appreciation from children and other fellow volunteers, has been my driving force that has let me a part of the Adhiyagya Family since 10 golden months.
