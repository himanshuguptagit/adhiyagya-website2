The greatest gift one can give to the society is the gift of knowledge. I joined adhiyagya as a leisure activity but soon it became one of my favourite places to go to. The team of volunteers and children here are so full of life and down to earth.

### Special Moment
Every moment spent here is special in its own ways. Either its students getting good marks in a test, or celebrating any festival/ birthday, participating in games and activities.
