First thing is I like to teach, specially to the kids as they help me become more imaginative at certain concepts. Secondly I think all of us should take some time out from our daily schedule to help our neighbooring communities to grow.

### Special Moment
In one of my class, I was helping the kids to understand the power of questioning each and everything while one is in learning phase, hence asking WHY untill you don't picture that concept!
So, I wrote it on the white board at top right location. In next class when I arrived the kids wrote the date and my name at top left (as they use to do) but this I saw at top right they wrote in caps 'WHY' as well and after that they keep writing in this way.
I wasn't aware that this small topic can struck them for such a long period of time.
